# Railpack configuration for Railway deployment
# Skip artisan cache commands during build to avoid APP_ENV secret requirement

[build]
# Override default build steps to skip artisan caching
# Artisan cache commands require APP_ENV which is only available at runtime
steps = [
    "mkdir -p storage/framework/{sessions,views,cache,testing} storage/logs bootstrap/cache",
    "chmod -R a+rw storage"
]

# Note: Artisan cache commands (config:cache, route:cache, view:cache, event:cache)
# are skipped during build. Laravel will work without caching and can be cached
# at runtime if needed via a startup script.
